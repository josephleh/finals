          We can all agree that a lot of people love basketball.

        <p class="the-importance-of">
          In fact, the sport is not just played on a professional level but also
          on the streets where open space, a ring, and 5 of your friends are
          just exactly what you need. Many basketball fans also love the sport
          because it’s a matter of teamwork, and exciting, and come on, it’s fun
          to watch! The mechanics of the sport is also easy to understand and
          the moves can simply be practiced (dribbling and shooting) – even the
          kids say so!

          But makin to the fun and interest basketball offers, the players of
          the sport have a heightened risk of ankle injuries. Here’s where the
          importance of ankle braces for basketball players comes in.

        <p class="ankle-sprains-are">
          Ankle Sprains are the most common ankle injuries in basketball. This
          occurs when you twist, rotate, or roll your ankle in a way it wasn’t
          supposed to. Lateral ankle ligament sprains hold 80% of all ankle
          sprains among basketball players.
        </p>
        <p class="ankle-sprains-are">
          In case you were wondering how to prevent ankle sprains, wearing
          protective gear such as basketball ankle braces with straps gives you
          lower chances of injuries. It’s also important to stretch and warm up
          prior to doing the sport. Lastly, make sure that you wear the right
          basketball shoes to avoid tripping on the court.

        <p class="ankle-sprains-are">
          Ankle braces are designed to provide support and stability for your
          ankle joint – especially when playing a physically demanding sport
          like basketball. If truth be told, a player wearing ankle braces has a
          lower chance of getting ankle injuries than three combined individuals
          playing without them. Also, a study states that incidents are 68%
          fewer if there are provided ankle support for basketball players. To
          make things more interesting, here are the benefits of wearing ankle
          braces during the said sport:
