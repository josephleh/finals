        <p class="we-have-chosen">
          We have chosen these shoes because out of the hundreds of shoes we
          have tested this year, these offer a great blend of performance
          features that will accommodate most playing styles. Check it out.
        </p>

        <p class="adidas-harden-vol">Nike LeBron 21</p>
        <p class="we-have-chosen">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="we-have-chosen">
          The Nike LeBron 21 promises to be a beast on court. It can be
          described as a remix of the Nike LeBron 20, and, that shoe was
          amazing, and in fact the best basketball shoe from last year. Barring
          any unfortunate surprises, this will be one of the top models this
          year, one of the most versatile, and one of the most comfortable on
          court, as well as an attainable Kobe substitute.
        </p>
        <p class="we-have-chosen">
          UPDATE: Make sure to buy a colorway that uses raw materials. Any
          colorway built with synthetics will not be with the while.

          <span class="the-nike-kd-16-is-very-differe"

          <span class="the-nike-kd-16-is-very-differe">
            (which was also an amazing hoop shoe) but there really haven't been
            any downgrades. We have a new gear-shaped traction pattern etched
            into a translucent rubber sole, an excellent cushioning system that
            combines a cushlon midsole a large zoom unit in the forefoot, and an
            Air Stroble that covers the midfoot and heel. Materials are nothing
            to write home about but the mix of textiles and synthetic leather
            works well on court, as do all the support features in the shoe.

        <p class="adidas-harden-vol">Adidas Harden Vol 7</p>
        <p class="adidas-harden-vol">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="we-have-chosen">
          The adidas Harden Vol 7 looks weird but feels great on foot. It is one
          of those shoes that definitely has that “wow” factor from the first
          time you lace them up.
        </p>
        <p class="we-have-chosen">
          With the Harden Vol 7 you get some really nice plush cushioning that
          combines Lightstrike in the forefoot and Boost in the heel. And it is
          the boost we all know and love. The Harden Vol 7 has great traction
          that combines solid and translucent rubber and herringbone and radial
          traction patterns. Finally! a plush adidas basketball shoe.

            performance basketball shoe. It also makes the Nike GT Jump 2 a more
            accessible model for the majority of basketball players out there
            that needed the added reactiveness and stability.
