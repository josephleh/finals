          Coaches need shooters. Shooting is a skill that is demonstrated by
          three key factors and all are important, but the most important is the
          third one on this list.
        </p>
        <p class="how-to-shoot">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="how-to-shoot">
          1. Great shooters have outstanding mechanics. Some people can be good
          shooters with improper shooting mechanics but the best of the best
          have picture-perfect shooting form. Tyler Herro has done the deep and
          personal work of having accurate shooting form. He has the three
          master keys that NBC Basketball religiously preaches and teaches. His
          feet anchor him and provide a stable base, consistently demonstrating
          that his power comes from his legs. He never allows the depth of his
          shooting to alter his mechanics but draws from the power in his legs
          the deeper he gets. His hands have the shooter's touch, his release is
          consistent, and his hand is relaxed and allows for pure rotation of
          the ball. He naturally finds seams quickly and the ball rotates with
          precision. His eyes are locked on the target and he wills the ball
          into the basket. He has the inner confidence that is seen in his laser
          focus. As his shot takes flight, he expects the ball to go in. He
          exerts his will over the ball through his mastery and commands the
          ball to do his will.

          2. Tyler Herro is consistent and his percentage demonstrates his
          consistency. Numbers do not lie. You can have a hot hand but the great
          shooters put up the numbers throughout the season. If you are not
          tracking your percentage in all shot categories, you are likely not
          yet a serious player. Serious players don't assume they are good
          shooters, they have the numbers to verify.
        </p>

        <p class="how-to-shoot">
          3. Great shooters are simply the hardest workers on the court. You
          don't get good at shooting without hours of dedicated practice
          shooting game shots at game spots at game speed. This is the
          separator. Herro put hours and hours into his shot and it is really
          evident. Confidence in your shot without practice is just cockiness.
          Your confidence should be the outcome of your hours in the gym. He
          doesn't have to hope he is a good shooter, he can will the ball into
          the basket because he has done it thousands of times every day for
          many years. He is a master shooter, he is a pure shooter.
        </p>
        <p class="how-to-shoot">What about you?</p>
        <p class="how-to-shoot">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="how-to-shoot">
          You can become a pure shooter. But do you love it enough? Many love
          the idea of basketball, the fun, and the thrill, but do you actually
          love the sport and the game enough to do the work when no one is
          watching.
          Need help with shooting mechanics? Here is a great teaching lesson.
          The NBC 9 Keys will make sure you are technically sound. Practice
          these every day. Get mentors, record your numbers, have a dedicated
          plan and here is a really key point have consequences for a miss. If
          you shoot and there is no real pressure, your practice is a cakewalk.
          Until every shot in practice matters and forces your mind to have some
          level of pressure, you are wasting your time. Do you have the courage
          to be a great shooter? Coaches are begging for pure shooters.
